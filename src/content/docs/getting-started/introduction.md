# Welcome to Halp UI Registry

Halp UI Registry is a curated collection of reusable React components built with **shadcn/ui v2** and **Base UI** primitives, styled with **Tailwind CSS v4**.

## What is Halp UI Registry?

This registry provides custom, production-ready components that you can easily add to your projects using the shadcn CLI. All components are:

- ✨ **Built with Base UI** - Modern, accessible primitives
- 🎨 **Styled with Tailwind v4** - CSS-first configuration with OKLCH colors
- 🔧 **Fully customizable** - Own the code, modify as needed
- ♿ **Accessible** - WCAG compliant components
- 📱 **Responsive** - Mobile-first design
- 🌗 **Dark mode ready** - Built-in theme support

## Technology Stack

- **shadcn/ui v2** - Component distribution platform
- **Base UI** - Accessible component primitives (successor to Radix UI)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS framework with CSS-first configuration
- **React 19** - Latest React features
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe components
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, consistent icons

## Philosophy

We follow the shadcn/ui "open code" philosophy:

- **You own the code** - Components are copied to your project, not installed as dependencies
- **Full control** - Modify components to fit your needs
- **No lock-in** - Use what you need, customize everything
- **Best practices** - Built with modern web standards
